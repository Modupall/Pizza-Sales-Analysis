# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
The Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to provide a holistic view of sales performance, customer preferences, and product demand patterns. It transforms raw sales data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making for improved business outcomes.
At the top, the dashboard shows important performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Pizza Sales (817.86K), Average Unit Price (16.49), Total Number of Orders (21.35K), and Total Pizzas Sold (50K). These numbers provide an immediate glimpse of overall business health and performance.

The monthly sales trend chart indicates fluctuations in pizzas sold during months, and the identification of peak demand times and seasonal patterns. This allows sales forecasting and matching production to it.

Customer behavior is examined using plots such as Preferred Days for Order, which shows that weekends and Fridays account for the most orders. These findings can help direct marketing campaigns, staffing rotas, and special offers.

The Preferred Pizza Size donut chart reflects a well-defined preference split, with Large and Medium-sized pizzas as the preferred options. This optimizes inventory levels and helps satisfy customer demand efficiently.

Product performance-wise, the quantity by pizza name and size bar chart gives detailed insights into individual pizza type sales for varying sizes. The sales by pizza category pie chart also segments revenue contributions from Classic, Supreme, Chicken, and Veggie pizzas, identifying which categories generate the most business.

Overall, the dashboard presents an easy-to-use and visually appealing platform for stakeholders to track sales trends, discern customer preferences, and analyze product performance. Based on these insights, companies can enhance strategies, streamline operations, and optimize profitability in the competitive food service market.
